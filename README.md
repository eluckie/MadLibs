## Description

This webpage acts as a virtual Mad Libs game. From the home page, users are able to select which topic of Mad Lib they would like to complete. Clicking on their selection takes them to a form where users are able to input random but specified parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.). When the form is submitted, their words are input into a story template (of the topic initially chosen from the home page) and displayed back to them.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called _MadLibs_.
3. In the command line, run the command ``dotnet run`` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run ``dotnet build`` to compile this console app without running it.
