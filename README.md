## Description

This webpage acts as a virtual Mad Libs game. From the home page, users are able to select which topic of Mad Lib they would like to complete. Clicking on their selection takes them to a form where users are able to input random but specified parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.). When the form is submitted, their words are input into a story template (of the topic initially chosen from the home page) and displayed back to them. From that point, they're able to click a link to take them back to the home page and choose another topic.
