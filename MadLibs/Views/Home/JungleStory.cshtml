  <h1>In the Jungle!</h1>
  <p>I walk through the color jungle. I take out my @Model.Adjective1 canteen. There's a @Model.Adjective2 parrot with a @Model.Adjective3 @Model.Noun1 in his mouth right there in front of me in the @Model.Adjective4 trees! I gaze at his @Model.Adjective5 @Model.Noun2. A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream! A panther’s @Model.Verb1 in front of my head! I @Model.Verb2 his @Model.Adjective6 breath. I remember I have a packet of @Model.Noun3 that makes go into a deep slumber! I @Model.Verb3 it away from me in front of the @Model.Noun4. Yes he's eating it! I @Model.Verb4 away through the @Model.Adjective7 jungle. I meet my parents at the tent. Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle. </p>
