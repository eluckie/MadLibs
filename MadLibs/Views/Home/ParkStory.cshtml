  <h1>The Fun Park!</h1>
  <p>Today, my fabulous camp group went to a(n) @Model.Adjective1 amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool @Model.PluralNoun and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the @Model.Noun." We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I @Model.Adverb1 ran over to get in the long line that had about @Model.Number people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was @Model.PastTenseVerb1. In fact I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together. This was the @Model.EstAdjective ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, I was a little @Model.PastTenseVerb2 but I was proud of myself. The rest of the day went @Model.Adverb2. It was a(n) @Model.Adjective2 day at the fun park.</p>
